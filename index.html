<h2>Implementation Description</h2>

<h3>Core Features (80 points)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Continuous Movement:</strong> Player moves smoothly through the environment using WASD controls, not in discrete grid jumps.</li>
  <li><strong>Walls & Doors:</strong> Walls and doors are rendered with unique appearances. Each of the five door types (A-E) has a distinct visual representation.</li>
  <li><strong>Keys:</strong> Keys are rendered as 3D objects in the world. When collected, they are displayed following the player's view.</li>
  <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Smooth movement with WASD keys and mouse look for camera rotation.</li>
  <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Players cannot move through walls or locked doors.</li>
  <li><strong>Floors & Ceilings:</strong> Floors are rendered with textures throughout the environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Scene includes ambient and diffuse lighting with Phong shading.</li>
  <li><strong>New Maps:</strong> Created multiple test maps (map1.txt, map2.txt, map3.txt) showcasing the game engine.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extra Features Implemented (20+ points)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integrated keyboard and mouse control (5 pts):</strong> Full WASD movement with strafing support and mouse look.</li>
  <li><strong>Jumping (5 pts):</strong> Smooth and realistic jumping mechanic implemented.</li>
  <li><strong>Texture mapping (5 pts):</strong> Different textures applied to walls and floors.</li>
  <li><strong>Video (5 pts):</strong> Gameplay video demonstrating all features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Issues Encountered</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initially had viewport issues when switching to fullscreen mode - resolved by properly updating OpenGL viewport dimensions.</li>
  <li>Key positioning required adjustment to prevent clipping through walls and doors when carried by the player.</li>
  <li>Collision detection needed fine-tuning to prevent getting stuck on corners.</li>
</ul>
